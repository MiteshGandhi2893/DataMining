
Steps to run the program.
1. You need to have python.exe to run the python code
2. After that run command python.exe DataMiningProject.py
3. This will create an output file ARoutput.txt which contains first line for overall sale and rest for th eindividual products



I have implemented the AR model from scratch have not used any inbuilt libraries.


Note** please run the code only once because it will append the overall sum of product in the product_distribution_training_set.txt many times which will inturn will make many entries for overall sale in ARoutput file
